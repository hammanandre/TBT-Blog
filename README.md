# TBTBlog

A blog for the sake of keeping log of a game's development.

Built on [Strawberry.](https://strawberry.quest/) well kinda...
Sofar a modified version of the strawberry framework site and some custom bits and pieces to toy with web tech.

In part an excuse to learn web frontend, in part collecting a history of game dev.
